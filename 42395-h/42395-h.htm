    <p class="scene"><i>The Scene is a stately drawing-room at Aston-Adey, with fine pictures on the walls and Georgian furniture. Aston-Adey has been described, with many illustrations, in Country Life. It is not a house, but a place. Its owner takes a great pride in it, and there is nothing in the room which is not of the period. Through the French windows at the back can be seen the beautiful gardens which are one of the features.</i></p>

    <p class="scene"><i>It is a fine summer morning.</i></p>

    <p class="scene"><i><span class="name">Arnold</span> comes in. He is a man of about thirty-five, tall and good-looking, fair, with a clean-cut, sensitive face. He has a look that is intellectual, but somewhat bloodless. He is very well dressed.</i></p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> [<i>Calling.</i>] Elizabeth! [<i>He goes to the window and calls again.</i>] Elizabeth! [<i>He rings the bell. While he is waiting he gives a look round the room. He slightly alters the position of one of the chairs. He takes an ornament from the chimney-piece and blows the dust from it.</i>]</p>

    <p class="direction">[<i>A <span class="name">Footman</span> comes in.</i></p>

    <p class="noindent">Oh, George! see if you can find Mrs. Cheney, and ask her if she’d be good enough to come here.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Footman.</span> Very good, sir.</p>

    <p class="direction">[<i>The <span class="name">Footman</span> turns to go.</i></p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> Who is supposed to look after this room?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Footman.</span> I don’t know, sir.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> I wish when they dust they’d take care to replace the things exactly as they were before.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="name">Footman.</span> Yes, sir.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> [<i>Dismissing him.</i>] All right.</p>

    <p class="direction">[<i>The <span class="name">Footman</span> goes out. He goes again to the window and calls.</i></p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> Elizabeth! [<i>He sees <span class="name">Mrs. Shenstone.</span></i>] Oh, Anna, do you know where Elizabeth is?</p>

    <p class="direction">[<i><span class="name">Mrs. Shenstone</span> comes in from the garden. She is a woman of forty, pleasant and of elegant appearance.</i></p>

    <p><span class="name">Anna.</span> Isn’t she playing tennis?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> No, I’ve been down to the tennis court. Something very tiresome has happened.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Anna.</span> Oh?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> I wonder where the deuce she is.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Anna.</span> When do you expect Lord Porteous and Lady Kitty?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> They’re motoring down in time for luncheon.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Anna.</span> Are you sure you want me to be here? It’s not too late yet, you know. I can have my things packed and catch a train for somewhere or other.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> No, of course we want you. It’ll make it so much easier if there are people here. It was exceedingly kind of you to come.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Anna.</span> Oh, nonsense!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> And I think it was a good thing to have Teddie Luton down.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Anna.</span> He is so breezy, isn’t he?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> Yes, that’s his great asset. I don’t know that he’s very intelligent, but, you know, there are occasions when you want a bull in a china shop. I sent one of the servants to find Elizabeth.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Anna.</span> I daresay she’s putting on her shoes. She and Teddie were going to have a single.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> It can’t take all this time to change one’s shoes.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Anna.</span> [<i>With a smile.</i>] One can’t change one’s shoes without powdering one’s nose, you know.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

    <p class="direction">[<i><span class="name">Elizabeth</span> comes in. She is a very pretty creature in the early twenties. She wears a light summer frock.</i></p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> My dear, I’ve been hunting for you everywhere. What <i>have</i> you been doing?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Nothing! I’ve been standing on my head.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> My father’s here.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> [<i>Startled.</i>] Where?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> At the cottage. He arrived last night.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Damn!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> [<i>Good-humouredly.</i>] I wish you wouldn’t say that, Elizabeth.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> If you’re not going to say “Damn” when a thing’s damnable, when are you going to say “Damn”?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> I should have thought you could say, “Oh, bother!” or something like that.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> But that wouldn’t express my sentiments. Besides, at that speech day when you were giving away the prizes you said there were no synonyms in the English language.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Anna.</span> [<i>Smiling.</i>] Oh, Elizabeth! it’s very unfair to expect a politician to live in private up to the statements he makes in public.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> I’m always willing to stand by anything I’ve said. There <i>are</i> no synonyms in the English language.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> In that case I shall be regretfully forced to continue to say “Damn” whenever I feel like it.</p>

    <p class="direction">[<i><span class="name">Edward Luton</span> shows himself at the window. He is an attractive youth in flannels.</i></p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> I say, what about this tennis?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Come in. We’re having a scene.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> [<i>Entering.</i>] How splendid! What about?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> The English language.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> Don’t tell me you’ve been splitting your infinitives.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> [<i>With the shadow of a frown.</i>] I wish you’d be serious, Elizabeth. The situation is none too pleasant.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="name">Anna.</span> I think Teddie and I had better make ourselves scarce.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Nonsense! You’re both in it. If there’s going to be any unpleasantness we want your moral support. That’s why we asked you to come.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> And I thought I’d been asked for my blue eyes.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Vain beast! And they happen to be brown.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> Is anything up?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Arnold’s father arrived last night.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> Did he, by Jove! I thought he was in Paris.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> So did we all. He told me he’d be there for the next month.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Anna.</span> Have you seen him?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> No! he rang me up. It’s a mercy he had a telephone put in the cottage. It would have been a pretty kettle of fish if he’d just walked in.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Did you tell him Lady Catherine was coming?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> Of course not. I was flabbergasted to know he was here. And then I thought we’d better talk it over first.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Is he coming along here?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> Yes. He suggested it, and I couldn’t think of any excuse to prevent him.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> Couldn’t you put the other people off?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> They’re coming by car. They may be here any minute. It’s too late to do that.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Besides, it would be beastly.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> I knew it was silly to have them here. Elizabeth insisted.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> After all, she <i>is</i> your mother, Arnold.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> That meant precious little to her when she—went away. You can’t imagine it means very much to me now.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> It’s thirty years ago. It seems so absurd to bear malice after all that time.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> I don’t bear malice, but the fact remains that she did me the most irreparable harm. I can find no excuse for her.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Have you ever tried to?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> My dear Elizabeth, it’s no good going over all that again. The facts are lamentably simple. She had a husband who adored her, a wonderful position, all the money she could want, and a child of five. And she ran away with a married man.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Lady Porteous is not a very attractive woman, Arnold. [<i>To <span class="name">Anna.</span></i>] Do you know her?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Anna.</span> [<i>Smiling.</i>] “Forbidding” is the word, I think.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> If you’re going to make little jokes about it, I have nothing more to say.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Anna.</span> I’m sorry, Arnold.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Perhaps your mother couldn’t help herself—if she was in love?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> And had no sense of honour, duty, or decency? Oh, yes, under those circumstances you can explain a great deal.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> That’s not a very pretty way to speak of your mother.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> I can’t look on her as my mother.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> What you can’t get over is that she didn’t think of you. Some of us are more mother and some of us more woman. It gives me a little thrill when I think that she loved that man so much. She sacrificed her name, her position, and her child to him.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> You really can’t expect the said child to have any great affection for the mother who treated him like that.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> No, I don’t think I do. But I think it’s a pity after all these years that you shouldn’t be friends.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> I wonder if you realise what it was to grow up under the shadow of that horrible scandal. Everywhere, at school, and at Oxford, and afterwards in<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-14">[Pg 14]</a></span> London, I was always the son of Lady Kitty Cheney. Oh, it was cruel, cruel!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Yes, I know, Arnold. It was beastly for you.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> It would have been bad enough if it had been an ordinary case, but the position of the people made it ten times worse. My father was in the House then, and Porteous—he hadn’t succeeded to the title—was in the House too; he was Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, and he was very much in the public eye.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Anna.</span> My father always used to say he was the ablest man in the party. Every one was expecting him to be Prime Minister.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> You can imagine what a boon it was to the British public. They hadn’t had such a treat for a generation. The most popular song of the day was about my mother. Did you ever hear it? “Naughty Lady Kitty. Thought it such a pity&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> [<i>Interrupting.</i>] Oh, Arnold, don’t!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> And then they never let people forget them. If they’d lived quietly in Florence and not made a fuss the scandal would have died down. But those constant actions between Lord and Lady Porteous kept on reminding everyone.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> What were they having actions about?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> Of course my father divorced his wife, but Lady Porteous refused to divorce Porteous. He tried to force her by refusing to support her and turning her out of her house, and heaven knows what. They were constantly wrangling in the law courts.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Anna.</span> I think it was monstrous of Lady Porteous.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> She knew he wanted to marry my mother, and she hated my mother. You can’t blame her.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Anna.</span> It must have been very difficult for them.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> That’s why they’ve lived in Florence. Porteous has money. They found people there who were willing to accept the situation.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> This is the first time they’ve ever come to England.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> My father will have to be told, Elizabeth.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Yes.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Anna.</span> [<i>To <span class="name">Elizabeth.</span></i>] Has he ever spoken to you about Lady Kitty?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Never.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> I don’t think her name has passed his lips since she ran away from this house thirty years ago.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> Oh, they lived here?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> Naturally. There was a house-party, and one evening neither Porteous nor my mother came down to dinner. The rest of them waited. They couldn’t make it out. My father sent up to my mother’s room, and a note was found on the pincushion.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> [<i>With a faint smile.</i>] That’s what they did in the Dark Ages.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> I think he took a dislike to this house from that horrible night. He never lived here again, and when I married he handed the place over to me. He just has a cottage now on the estate that he comes to when he feels inclined.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> It’s been very nice for us.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> I owe everything to my father. I don’t think he’ll ever forgive me for asking these people to come here.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> I’m going to take all the blame on myself, Arnold.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> [<i>Irritably.</i>] The situation was embarrassing enough anyhow. I don’t know how I ought to treat them.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Don’t you think that’ll settle itself when you see them?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> After all, they’re my guests. I shall try and behave like a gentleman.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> I wouldn’t. We haven’t got central heating.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> [<i>Taking no notice.</i>] Will she expect me to kiss her?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> [<i>With a smile.</i>] Surely.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> It always makes me uncomfortable when people are effusive.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Anna.</span> But I can’t understand why you never saw her before.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> I believe she tried to see me when I was little, but my father thought it better she shouldn’t.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Anna.</span> Yes, but when you were grown up?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> She was always in Italy. I never went to Italy.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> It seems to me so pathetic that if you saw one another in the street you wouldn’t recognise each other.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> Is it my fault?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> You’ve promised to be very gentle with her and very kind.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> The mistake was asking Porteous to come too. It looks as though we condoned the whole thing. And how am I to treat him? Am I to shake him by the hand and slap him on the back? He absolutely ruined my father’s life.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> [<i>Smiling.</i>] How much would you give for a nice motor accident that prevented them from coming?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> I let you persuade me against my better judgment, and I’ve regretted it ever since.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> [<i>Good-humouredly.</i>] I think it’s very lucky that Anna and Teddie are here. I don’t foresee a very successful party.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> I’m going to do my best. I gave you my promise and I shall keep it. But I can’t answer for my father.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Anna.</span> Here is your father.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> And what are the F.M.S. when they’re at home?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> The Federated Malay States. He joined up at the beginning of the war. He’s just going back there.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Have we? I didn’t notice it.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> I suppose it’s difficult for the young to realise that one may be old without being a fool.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> I never thought you that. Everyone knows you’re very intelligent.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> They certainly ought to by now. I’ve told them often enough. Are you a little nervous?</p>

    <p class="direction">[<i>He withdraws himself a little and <span class="name">Elizabeth</span> gets up.</i></p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> You mustn’t blame Arnold. It’s my fault.<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-20">[Pg 20]</a></span> I insisted. He was against it. I nagged him till he gave way. And then I wrote and asked her to come.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> I didn’t know you knew her.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> I don’t. But I heard she was in London. She’s staying at Claridge’s. It seemed so heartless not to take the smallest notice of her.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> When is she coming?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> We’re expecting her in time for luncheon.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> As soon as that? I understand the embarrassment.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> You see, we never expected you to be here. You said you’d be in Paris for another month.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> My dear child, this is your house. There’s no reason why you shouldn’t ask whom you please to stay with you.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> After all, whatever her faults, she’s Arnold’s mother. It seemed so unnatural that they should never see one another. My heart ached for that poor lonely woman.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> I never heard that she was lonely, and she certainly isn’t poor.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> And there’s something else. I couldn’t ask her by herself. It would have been so—so insulting. I asked Lord Porteous, too.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> I see.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> I daresay you’d rather not meet them.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> I daresay they’d rather not meet me. I shall get a capital luncheon at the cottage. I’ve noticed you always get the best food if you come in unexpectedly and have the same as they’re having in the servants’ hall.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> No one’s ever talked to me about Lady Kitty. It’s always been a subject that everyone has avoided. I’ve never even seen a photograph of her.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> The house was full of them when she left. I think I told the butler to throw them in the dust-bin. She was very much photographed.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Won’t you tell me what she was like?</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> She was very like you, Elizabeth, only she had dark hair instead of red.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Poor dear! it must be quite white now.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> I daresay. She was a pretty little thing.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> But she was one of the great beauties of her day. They say she was lovely.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> She had the most adorable little nose, like yours.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> D’you like my nose?</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> And she was very dainty, with a beautiful little figure; very light on her feet. She was like a <i>marquise</i> in an old French comedy. Yes, she was lovely.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> And I’m sure she’s lovely still.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> She’s no chicken, you know.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> You can’t expect me to look at it as you and Arnold do. When you’ve loved as she’s loved you may grow old, but you grow old beautifully.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> You’re very romantic.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> If everyone hadn’t made such a mystery of it I daresay I shouldn’t feel as I do. I know she did a great wrong to you and a great wrong to Arnold. I’m willing to acknowledge that.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> I’m sure it’s very kind of you.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> But she loved and she dared. Romance is such an illusive thing. You read of it in books, but it’s seldom you see it face to face. I can’t help it if it thrills me.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> I am painfully aware that the husband in these cases is not a romantic object.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> She had the world at her feet. You were rich. She was a figure in society. And she gave up everything for love.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> [<i>Dryly.</i>] I’m beginning to suspect it wasn’t only for her sake and for Arnold’s that you asked her to come here.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> I seem to know her already. I think her face is a little sad, for a love like that doesn’t leave you<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-22">[Pg 22]</a></span> gay, it leaves you grave, but I think her pale face is unlined. It’s like a child’s.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> My dear, how you let your imagination run away with you!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> I imagine her slight and frail.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> Frail, certainly.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> With beautiful thin hands and white hair. I’ve pictured her so often in that Renaissance Palace that they live in, with old Masters on the walls and lovely carved things all round, sitting in a black silk dress with old lace round her neck and old-fashioned diamonds. You see, I never knew my mother; she died when I was a baby. You can’t confide in aunts with huge families of their own. I want Arnold’s mother to be a mother to me. I’ve got so much to say to her.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> Are you happy with Arnold?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Why shouldn’t I be?</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> Why haven’t you got any babies?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Give us a little time. We’ve only been married three years.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> I wonder what Hughie is like now!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Lord Porteous?</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> He wore his clothes better than any man in London. You know he’d have been Prime Minister if he’d remained in politics.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> What was he like then?</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> He was a nice-looking fellow. Fine horseman. I suppose there was something very fascinating about him. Yellow hair and blue eyes, you know. He had a very good figure. I liked him. I was his parliamentary secretary. He was Arnold’s godfather.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> I know.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> I wonder if he ever regrets!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> I wouldn’t.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> Well, I must be strolling back to my cottage.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> You’re not angry with me?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> [<i>Smiling.</i>] What’s wrong with England?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> I don’t think anything’s wrong with England. I expect something’s wrong with me. I’ve been away too long. England seems to me full of people doing things they don’t want to because other people expect it of them.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> People seem to me so insincere. When you go to parties in London they’re all babbling about art, and you feel that in their hearts they don’t care twopence<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-24">[Pg 24]</a></span> about it. They read the books that everybody is talking about because they don’t want to be out of it. In the F.M.S. we don’t get very many books, and we read those we have over and over again. They mean so much to us. I don’t think the people over there are half so clever as the people at home, but one gets to know them better. You see, there are so few of us that we have to make the best of one another.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> It’s not much good being pretentious where everyone knows exactly who you are and what your income is.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> I don’t think you want too much sincerity in society. It would be like an iron girder in a house of cards.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> And then, you know, the place is ripping. You get used to a blue sky and you miss it in England.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> Lots of girls come out because they think they’re going to have a good time. But if they’re empty-headed, then they’re just faced with their own emptiness and they’re done. If their husbands can afford it they go home and settle down as grass-widows.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> I’ve met them. They seem to find it a very pleasant occupation.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> It’s rotten for their husbands, though.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> And if the husbands can’t afford it?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> Oh, then they tipple.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> It’s not a very alluring prospect.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> But if the woman’s the right sort she wouldn’t exchange it for any life in the world. When all’s said and done it’s we who’ve made the Empire.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> What sort is the right sort?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> A woman of courage and endurance and sincerity. Of course, it’s hopeless unless she’s in love with her husband.</p>

    <p class="direction">[<i>He is looking at her earnestly and she, raising her eyes, gives him a long look. There is silence between them.</i></p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> My house stands on the side of a hill, and the cocoanut trees wind down to the shore. Azaleas grow in my garden, and camellias, and all sorts of ripping flowers. And in front of me is the winding coast line, and then the blue sea.</p>

Of course I think he’s the very image of me. Arnold, I think I ought to tell you that I was received into the Catholic Church last winter. I’d been thinking about it for years, and last time we were at Monte Carlo I met such a nice monsignore. I told him what my difficulties were and he was too wonderful.

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> When will Arnold be back, Elizabeth?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Soon, I think.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> Is he addressing a meeting?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> No, it’s only a conference with his agent and one or two constituents.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> [<i>Irritably.</i>] How anyone can be expected to play bridge when people are shouting at the top of their voices all round them, I for one cannot understand.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> [<i>Smiling.</i>] I’m so sorry.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Anna.</span> I can see your hand, Lord Porteous.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> It may help you.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> I’ve told you over and over again to hold your cards up. It ruins one’s game when one can’t help seeing one’s opponent’s hand.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> One isn’t obliged to look.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> What was Arnold’s majority at the last election?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Seven hundred and something.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> He’ll have to fight for it if he wants to keep his seat next time.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> Are we playing bridge, or talking politics?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> I never find that conversation interferes with my game.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> You certainly play no worse when you talk than when you hold your tongue.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> I think that’s a very offensive thing to say, Hughie. Just because I don’t play the same game as you do you think I can’t play.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> I’m glad you acknowledge it’s not the same game as I play. But why in God’s name do you call it bridge?</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> I agree with Kitty. I hate people who play bridge as though they were at a funeral and knew their feet were getting wet.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> Of course you take Kitty’s part.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> That’s the least he can do.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> I have a naturally cheerful disposition.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> You’ve never had anything to sour it.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> I don’t know what you mean by that, Hughie.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> [<i>Trying to contain himself.</i>] Must you trump my ace?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> [<i>Innocently.</i>] Oh, was that your ace, darling?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> [<i>Furiously.</i>] Yes, it was my ace.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Oh, well, it was the only trump I had. I shouldn’t have made it anyway.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> You needn’t have told them that. Now she knows exactly what I’ve got.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> She knew before.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> How could she know?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> She said she’d seen your hand.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Anna.</span> Oh, I didn’t. I said I could see it.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Well, I naturally supposed that if she could see it she did.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> Really, Kitty, you have the most extraordinary ideas.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> Not at all. If anyone is such a fool as to show me his hand, of course I look at it.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> [<i>Fuming.</i>] If you study the etiquette of bridge, you’ll discover that onlookers are expected not to interfere with the game.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> My dear Hughie, this is a matter of ethics, not of bridge.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Anna.</span> Anyhow, I get the game. And rubber.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> I claim a revoke.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> Who revoked?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> You did.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> Nonsense. I’ve never revoked in my life.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> I’ll show you. [<i>He turns over the tricks to show the faces of the cards.</i>] You threw away a club on the third heart trick and you had another heart.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> [<i>With a chuckle.</i>] You are a devil, you know.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> Ah, well, he’s always had the reputation of being a humorist and a gentleman.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Did <i>you</i> expect her to be like that, poor dear?</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> My dear child, I hadn’t the vaguest idea. You were asking me the other day what she was like when she ran away. I didn’t tell you half. She was so gay and so natural. Who would have thought that animation would turn into such frivolity, and that charming impulsiveness lead to such a ridiculous affectation?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> It rather sets my nerves on edge to hear the way you talk of her.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> It’s the truth that sets your nerves on edge, not I.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> You loved her once. Have you no feeling for her at all?</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> My dear child, you have a charming nature, as simple, frank, and artless as hers was. Don’t let pure humbug obscure your common sense.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> We have no right to judge. She’s only been here two days. We know nothing about her.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> My dear, her soul is as thickly rouged as her face. She hasn’t an emotion that’s sincere. She’s tinsel. You think I’m a cruel, cynical old man. Why, when I think of what she was, if I didn’t laugh at what she has become I should cry.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> How do you know she wouldn’t be just<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-41">[Pg 41]</a></span> the same now if she’d remained your wife? Do you think your influence would have had such a salutary effect on her?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> D’you like me enough to answer my question?</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> She was only twenty-seven when she went away. She might have become anything. She might have become the woman you expected her to be. There are very few of us who are strong enough to make circumstances serve us. We are the creatures of our environment. She’s a silly, worthless woman because she’s led a silly, worthless life.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> [<i>Disturbed.</i>] You’re horrible to-day.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> I don’t say it’s I who could have prevented her from becoming this ridiculous caricature of a pretty woman grown old. But life could. Here she would have had the friends fit to her station, and a decent activity, and worthy interests. Ask her what her life has been all these years among divorced women and kept women and the men who consort with them. There is no more lamentable pursuit than a life of pleasure.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> At all events she loved and she loved greatly. I have only pity and affection for her.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> And if she loved what d’you think she felt when she saw that she had ruined Hughie? Look at him. He was tight last night after dinner and tight the night before.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> I know.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> And she took it as a matter of course. How long do you suppose he’s been getting tight every night? Do you think he was like that thirty years ago? Can you imagine that that was a brilliant young man, whom everyone expected to be Prime Minister? Look at him now. A grumpy sodden old fellow with false teeth.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> You have false teeth, too.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> No.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> [<i>Frowning.</i>] It makes me feel rather shy and awkward. I’ve repeated to myself over and over again exactly what I want to say to you, and now all I’d prepared seems rather footling.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> I feel it’s all so tremendously serious and I think we ought to keep emotion out of it. You’re rather emotional, aren’t you?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> [<i>Half smiling and half in tears.</i>] So are you for the matter of that.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> That’s why I wanted to have everything I meant to say to you cut and dried. I think it would be awfully unfair if I made love to you and all that sort of thing, and you were carried away. I wrote it all down and thought I’d send it you as a letter.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Why didn’t you?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> I got the wind up. A letter seems so—so cold. You see, I love you so awfully.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> You know, I don’t really know how to make love, but if I did I couldn’t do it now because I just want to be absolutely practical.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> [<i>Chaffing him.</i>] I’m glad you don’t know how to make love. It would be almost more than I could bear.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> You see, I’m not at all romantic and that sort of thing. I’m just a common or garden business man. All this is so dreadfully serious and I think we ought to be sensible.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> I saw you come in. Oh, my dear, don’t get up. There’s no reason why you should be so dreadfully polite to me.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> I’ve just rung for a cup of tea.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Perhaps we shall have the chance of a little talk. We don’t seem to have had five minutes by ourselves. I want to make your acquaintance, you know.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> I should like you to know that it’s not by my wish that my father is here.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> But I’m so interested to see him.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> I was afraid that you and Lord Porteous must find it embarrassing.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Oh, no. Hughie was his greatest friend. They were at Eton and Oxford together. I think your father has improved so much since I saw him last. He wasn’t good-looking as a young man, but now he’s quite handsome.</p>

    <p class="direction">[<i>The <span class="name">Footman</span> brings in a tray on which are tea-things.</i></p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Shall I pour it out for you?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> Thank you very much.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Do you take sugar?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> No. I gave it up during the war.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> So wise of you. It’s so bad for the figure. Besides being patriotic, of course. Isn’t it absurd that I should ask my son if he takes sugar or not? Life is really very quaint. Sad, of course, but oh, so quaint! Often I lie in bed at night and have a good laugh to myself as I think how quaint life is.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> I’m afraid I’m a very serious person.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> How old are you now, Arnold?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> Thirty-five.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Are you really? Of course, I was a child when I married your father.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> Really. He always told me you were twenty-two.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Oh, what nonsense! Why, I was married out of the nursery. I put my hair up for the first time on my wedding-day.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> Where is Lord Porteous?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> My dear, it sounds too absurd to hear<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-49">[Pg 49]</a></span> you call him Lord Porteous. Why don’t you call him—Uncle Hughie?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> He doesn’t happen to be my uncle.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> No, but he’s your godfather. You know, I’m sure you’ll like him when you know him better. I’m so hoping that you and Elizabeth will come and stay with us in Florence. I simply adore Elizabeth. She’s too beautiful.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> Her hair is very pretty.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> It’s not touched up, is it?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> Oh, no.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> I just wondered. It’s rather a coincidence that her hair should be the same colour as mine. I suppose it shows that your father and you are attracted by just the same thing. So interesting, heredity, isn’t it?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> Very.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Of course, since I joined the Catholic Church I don’t believe in it any more. Darwin and all that sort of thing. Too dreadful. Wicked, you know. Besides, it’s not very good form, is it?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Come in, Clive. Arnold and I have been having such a wonderful heart-to-heart talk.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> Very nice.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> Father, I stepped in for a moment at the Harveys’ on my way back. It’s simply criminal what they’re doing with that house.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> What are they doing?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> It’s an almost perfect Georgian house and they’ve got a lot of dreadful Victorian furniture. I gave them my ideas on the subject, but it’s quite hopeless. They said they were attached to their furniture.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> Arnold should have been an interior decorator.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> He has wonderful taste. He gets that from me.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> I suppose I have a certain <i>flair.</i> I have a passion for decorating houses.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> You’ve made this one charming.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> D’you remember, we just had chintzes and comfortable chairs when we lived here, Kitty.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Perfectly hideous, wasn’t it?</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> In those days gentlemen and ladies were not expected to have taste.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> You know, I’ve been looking at this chair again. Since Lord Porteous said the legs weren’t right I’ve been very uneasy.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> He only said that because he was in a bad temper.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> His temper seems to me very short these days, Kitty.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Oh, it is.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> You feel he knows what he’s talking about. I gave seventy-five pounds for that chair. I’m very seldom taken in. I always think if a thing’s right you feel it.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> Well, don’t let it disturb your night’s rest.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> But, my dear father, that’s just what it does. I had a most horrible dream about it last night.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Here is Hughie.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> I’m going to fetch a book I have on Old English furniture. There’s an illustration of a chair which is almost identical with this one.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> I don’t know what you want to be hanging around here for.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> A natural attachment to my home.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> If you’d had any tact you’d have kept out of the way while we were here.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> My dear Hughie, I don’t understand your attitude at all. If I’m willing to let bygones be bygones why should you object?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> Damn it all, they’re not bygones.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> After all, I am the injured party.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> How the devil are you the injured party?</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> Well, you did run away with my wife, didn’t you?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Now, don’t let’s go into ancient history. I can’t see why we shouldn’t all be friends.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> I beg you not to interfere, Kitty.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> I’m very fond of Clive.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> You never cared two straws for Clive. You only say that to irritate me.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Not at all. I don’t see why he shouldn’t come and stay with us.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> I’d love to. I think Florence in spring-time is delightful. Have you central heating?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> I never liked you, I don’t like you now, and I never shall like you.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> How very unfortunate! because I liked you, I like you now, and I shall continue to like you.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> There’s something very nice about you, Clive.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> If you think that, why the devil did you leave him?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Are you going to reproach me because I loved you? How utterly, utterly, utterly detestable you are!</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> Now, now, don’t quarrel with one another.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> It’s all his fault. I’m the easiest person in the world to live with. But really he’d try the patience of a saint.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> Come, come, don’t get upset, Kitty. When two people live together there must be a certain amount of give and take.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> I don’t know what the devil you’re talking about.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> It hasn’t escaped my observation that you are a little inclined to frip. Many couples are. I think it’s a pity.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> Would you have the very great kindness to mind your own business?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> It is his business. He naturally wants me to be happy.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> I have the very greatest affection for Kitty.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> Then why the devil didn’t you look after her properly?</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> My dear Hughie, you were my greatest friend. I trusted you. It may have been rash.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> It was inexcusable.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> I don’t know what you mean by that, Hughie.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> Don’t, don’t, don’t try and bully me, Kitty.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Oh, I know what you mean.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> Then why the devil did you say you didn’t?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> When I think that I sacrificed everything for that man! And for thirty years I’ve had to live in a filthy marble palace with no sanitary conveniences.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> D’you mean to say you haven’t got a bathroom?</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> I’ve had to wash in a tub.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> My poor Kitty, how you’ve suffered!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> Really, Kitty, I’m sick of hearing of the sacrifices you made. I suppose you think I sacrificed nothing. I should have been Prime Minister by now if it hadn’t been for you.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Nonsense!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> What do you mean by that? Everyone said I should be Prime Minister. Shouldn’t I have been Prime Minister, Clive?</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> It was certainly the general expectation.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> I was the most promising young man of my day. I was bound to get a seat in the Cabinet at the next election.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> They’d have found you out just as I’ve found you out. I’m sick of hearing that I ruined your career. You never had a career to ruin. Prime Minister! You haven’t the brain. You haven’t the character.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> Cheek, push, and a gift of the gab will serve very well instead, you know.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Besides, in politics it’s not the men that matter. It’s the women at the back of them. I could have made Clive a Cabinet Minister if I’d wanted to.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> Clive?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> With my beauty, my charm, my force of character, my wit, I could have done anything.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> Clive was nothing but my political secretary. When I was Prime Minister I might have made him Governor of some Colony or other. Western Australia, say. Out of pure kindliness.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> [<i>With flashing eyes.</i>] D’you think I would have buried myself in Western Australia? With my beauty? My charm?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> Or Barbadoes, perhaps.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> [<i>Furiously.</i>] Barbadoes! Barbadoes can go to—Barbadoes.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> I tell you I wouldn’t.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> In the eyes of the Church I am still your wife. The Church is so wise. It knows that in the end a woman always comes back to her first love. Clive, I am willing to return to you.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Men are so vain.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> But I was a student of history, and presently I reflected that I shared my misfortune with very nearly all the greatest men.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> I’m a great reader myself. It has always struck me as peculiar.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> The explanation is very simple. Women dislike intelligence, and when they find it in their husbands they revenge themselves on them in the only way they can, by making them—well, what you made me.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> It’s ingenious. It may be true.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> I felt I had done my duty by society and I determined to devote the rest of my life to my own entertainment. The House of Commons had always bored me excessively and the scandal of our divorce gave me an opportunity to resign my seat. I have been relieved to find that the country got on perfectly well without me.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> But has love never entered your life?</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> For some years I was notoriously the prey of a secret sorrow. But I found so many charming creatures who were anxious to console that in the end it grew rather fatiguing. Out of regard to my health I ceased to frequent the drawing-rooms of Mayfair.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> And since then?</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> Since then I have allowed myself the luxury of assisting financially a succession of dear little things, in a somewhat humble sphere, between the ages of twenty and twenty-five.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> I cannot understand the infatuation of men for young girls. I think they’re so dull.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> It’s a matter of taste. I love old wine, old friends and old books, but I like young women. On their twenty-fifth birthday I give them a diamond ring and tell them they must no longer waste their youth and beauty on an old fogey like me.

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> I shouldn’t have spoken to you if I hadn’t quite made up my mind. We’ve been married for three years and I don’t think it’s been a great success. I’m frankly bored by the life you want me to lead.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> Well, if you’ll allow me to say so, the fault is yours. We lead a very distinguished, useful life. We know a lot of extremely nice people.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> I’m quite willing to allow that the fault is mine. But how does that make it any better? I’m only twenty-five. If I’ve made a mistake I have time to correct it.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> I can’t bring myself to take you very seriously.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> You see, I don’t love you.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> Well, I’m awfully sorry. But you weren’t obliged to marry me. You’ve made your bed and I’m afraid you must lie on it.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> That’s one of the falsest proverbs in the English language. Why should you lie on the bed you’ve made if you don’t want to? There’s always the floor.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> For goodness’ sake don’t be funny, Elizabeth.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> I’ve quite made up my mind to leave you, Arnold.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> Come, come, Elizabeth, you must be sensible. You haven’t any reason to leave me.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Why should you wish to keep a woman tied to you who wants to be free?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> I happen to be in love with you.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> You might have said that before.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> I thought you’d take it for granted. You can’t expect a man to go on making love to his wife after three years. I’m very busy. I’m awfully keen on politics and I’ve worked like a dog to make this house a thing of beauty. After all, a man marries to have a home, but also because he doesn’t want to be bothered with sex and<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-59">[Pg 59]</a></span> all that sort of thing. I fell in love with you the first time I saw you and I’ve been in love ever since.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> I’m sorry, but if you’re not in love with a man his love doesn’t mean very much to you.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> It’s so ungrateful. I’ve done everything in the world for you.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> You’ve been very kind to me. But you’ve asked me to lead a life I don’t like and that I’m not suited for. I’m awfully sorry to cause you pain, but now you must let me go.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> Nonsense! I’m a good deal older than you are and I think I have a little more sense. In your interests as well as in mine I’m not going to do anything of the sort.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> [<i>With a smile.</i>] How can you prevent me? You can’t keep me under lock and key.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> Please don’t talk to me as if I were a foolish child. You’re my wife and you’re going to remain my wife.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> What sort of a life do you think we should lead? Do you think there’d be any more happiness for you than for me?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> But what is it precisely that you suggest?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Well, I want you to let me divorce you.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> [<i>Astounded.</i>] Me? Thank you very much. Are you under the impression I’m going to sacrifice my career for a whim of yours?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> How will it do that?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> My seat’s wobbly enough as it is. Do you think I’d be able to hold it if I were in a divorce case? Even if it were a put-up job, as most divorces are nowadays, it would damn me.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> It’s rather hard on a woman to be divorced.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> [<i>With sudden suspicion.</i>] What do you mean by that? Are you in love with some one?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Yes.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> Who?</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Teddie Luton.</p>

    <p class="direction">[<i>He is astonished for a moment, then bursts into a laugh.</i></p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> My poor child, how can you be so ridiculous? Why, he hasn’t a bob. He’s a perfectly commonplace young man. It’s so absurd I can’t even be angry with you.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> I’ve fallen desperately in love with him, Arnold.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> Well, you’d better fall desperately out.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> He wants to marry me.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> I daresay he does. He can go to hell.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> It’s no good talking like that.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> Is he your lover?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> No, certainly not.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> It shows that he’s a mean skunk to take advantage of my hospitality to make love to you.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> He’s never even kissed me.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> I’d try telling that to the horse marines if I were you.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> It’s because I wanted to do nothing shabby that I told you straight out how things were.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> How long have you been thinking of this?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> I’ve been in love with Teddie ever since I knew him.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> And you never thought of me at all, I suppose.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Oh, yes, I did. I was miserable. But I can’t help myself. I wish I loved you, but I don’t.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> I recommend you to think very carefully before you do anything foolish.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> I have thought very carefully.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> By God! I don’t know why I don’t give you a sound hiding. I’m not sure if that wouldn’t be the best thing to bring you to your senses.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Oh, Arnold, don’t take it like that.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> How do you expect me to take it? You come to me quite calmly and say: “I’ve had enough of you. We’ve been married three years and I think I’d like to marry somebody else now. Shall I break up your home?<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-61">[Pg 61]</a></span> What a bore for you! Do you mind my divorcing you? It’ll smash up your career, will it? What a pity!” Oh, no, my girl, I may be a fool, but I’m not a damned fool.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Teddie is leaving here by the first train to-morrow. I warn you that I mean to join him as soon as he can make the necessary arrangements.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> Where is he?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> I don’t know. I suppose he’s in his room.</p>

    <p class="direction">[<i><span class="name">Arnold</span> goes to the door and calls.</i></p>

    <p class="direction">[<i>For a moment he walks up and down the room impatiently. <span class="name">Elizabeth</span> watches him. The <span class="name">Footman</span> comes in.</i></p>

    <p><span class="name">Footman.</span> Yes, sir.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> Tell Mr. Luton to come here at once.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Ask Mr. Luton if he wouldn’t mind coming here for a moment.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Footman.</span> Very good, madam.</p>

    <p class="direction">[<i>Exit <span class="name">Footman.</span></i></p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> What are you going to say to him?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> That’s my business.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> I wouldn’t make a scene if I were you.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> I’m not going to make a scene.</p>

    <p class="direction">[<i>They wait in silence.</i></p>

    <p class="noindent">Why did you insist on my mother coming here?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> It seemed to me rather absurd to take up the attitude that I should be contaminated by her when&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> [<i>Interrupting.</i>] When you were proposing to do exactly the same thing. Well, now you’ve seen her what do you think of her? Do you think it’s been a success? Is that the sort of woman a man would like his mother to be?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> I’ve been ashamed. I’ve been so sorry. It all seemed dreadful and horrible. This morning I happened to notice a rose in the garden. It was all overblown and bedraggled. It looked like a painted old woman. And I remembered that I’d looked at it a day<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-62">[Pg 62]</a></span> or two ago. It was lovely then, fresh and blooming and fragrant. It may be hideous now, but that doesn’t take away from the beauty it had once. That was real.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> Poetry, by God! As if this were the moment for poetry!</p>

    <p class="direction">[<i><span class="name">Teddie</span> comes in. He has changed into a dinner jacket.</i></p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> [<i>To <span class="name">Elizabeth.</span></i>] Did you want me?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> <i>I</i> sent for you.</p>

    <p class="noindent">When would it be convenient for you to leave this house?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> I was proposing to go to-morrow morning. But I can very well go at once if you like.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> I do like.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> Very well. Is there anything else you wish to say to me?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> Do you think it was a very honourable thing to come down here and make love to my wife?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> No, I don’t. I haven’t been very happy about it. That’s why I wanted to go away.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> Upon my word you’re cool.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> I’m afraid it’s no good saying I’m sorry and that sort of thing. You know what the situation is.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> Is it true that you want to marry Elizabeth?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> Yes. I should like to marry her as soon as ever I can.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> Have you thought of me at all? Has it struck you that you’re destroying my home and breaking up my happiness?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> I don’t see how there could be much happiness for you if Elizabeth doesn’t care for you.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> Let me tell you that I refuse to have my home broken up by a twopenny-halfpenny adventurer who takes advantage of a foolish woman. I refuse to allow myself to be divorced. I can’t prevent my wife from going off with you if she’s determined to make a damned fool of<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-63">[Pg 63]</a></span> herself, but this I tell you: nothing will induce me to divorce her.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Arnold, that would be monstrous.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> We could force you.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> How?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> If we went away together openly you’d have to bring an action.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> Twenty-four hours after you leave this house I shall go down to Brighton with a chorus-girl. And neither you nor I will be able to get a divorce. We’ve had enough divorces in our family. And now get out, get out, get out!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> I don’t like it, you know. It’s against all my principles.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> My dear Arnold, we all hope that you have before you a distinguished political career. You can’t learn too soon that the most useful thing about a principle is that it can always be sacrificed to expediency.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> But supposing it doesn’t come off? Women are incalculable.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> Nonsense! Men are romantic. A woman will always sacrifice herself if you give her the opportunity. It is her favourite form of self-indulgence.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> I never know whether you’re a humorist or a cynic, father.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> I’m neither, my dear boy; I’m merely a very truthful man. But people are so unused to the truth that they’re apt to mistake it for a joke or a sneer.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> [<i>Irritably.</i>] It seems so unfair that this should happen to me.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> Keep your head, my boy, and do what I tell you.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> Arnold and I have just been down to my cottage.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> I wondered where you’d gone.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> I came across an old photograph album this afternoon. I meant to bring it along before dinner, but I forgot, so we went and fetched it.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Oh, do let me see it! I love old photographs.</p>

    <p class="direction">[<i>He gives her the album, and she, sitting down, puts it on her knees and begins to turn over the pages. He stands over her. <span class="name">Lady Kitty</span> and <span class="name">Porteous</span> take surreptitious glances at one another.</i></p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> I thought it might amuse you to see what pretty women looked like five-and-thirty years ago. That was the day of beautiful women.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Do you think they were more beautiful then than they are now?</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> Oh, much. Now you see lots of pretty little things, but very few beautiful women.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Aren’t their clothes funny?</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> [<i>Pointing to a photograph.</i>] That’s Mrs. Langtry.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> She has a lovely nose.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> She was the most wonderful thing you ever saw. Dowagers used to jump on chairs in order to get<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-69">[Pg 69]</a></span> a good look at her when she came into a drawing-room. I was riding with her once, and we had to have the gates of the livery stable closed when she was getting on her horse because the crowd was so great.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> And who’s that?</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> Lady Lonsdale. That’s Lady Dudley.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> This is an actress, isn’t it?</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> It is, indeed. Ellen Terry. By George! how I loved that woman!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> [<i>With a smile.</i>] Dear Ellen Terry!</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> That’s Bwabs. I never saw a smarter man in my life. And Oliver Montagu. Henry Manners with his eye-glass.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Nice-looking, isn’t he? And this?</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> That’s Mary Anderson. I wish you could have seen her in “A Winter’s Tale.” Her beauty just took your breath away. And look! There’s Lady Randolph. Bernal Osborne—the wittiest man I ever knew.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> I think it’s too sweet. I love their absurd bustles and those tight sleeves.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> What figures they had! In those days a woman wasn’t supposed to be as thin as a rail and as flat as a pancake.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Oh, but aren’t they laced in? How could they bear it?</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> They didn’t play golf then, and nonsense like that, you know. They hunted, in a tall hat and a long black habit, and they were very gracious and charitable to the poor in the village.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Did the poor like it?</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> They had a very thin time if they didn’t. When they were in London they drove in the Park every afternoon, and they went to ten-course dinners, where they never met anybody they didn’t know. And they had their box at the opera when Patti was singing or Madame Albani.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Oh, what a lovely little thing! Who on earth is that?</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> That?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> She looks so fragile, like a piece of exquisite china, with all those furs on and her face up against her muff, and the snow falling.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> Yes, there was quite a rage at that time for being taken in an artificial snowstorm.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> What a sweet smile, so roguish and frank, and debonair! Oh, I wish I looked like that! Do tell me who it is!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> No.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> Why—it’s Kitty.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Lady Kitty! [<i>To <span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span></i>] Oh, my dear, do look! It’s too ravishing. [<i>She takes the album over to her impulsively.</i>] Why didn’t you tell me you looked like that? Everybody must have been in love with you.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> I’d have given you India, you know. I think it would have been a very popular appointment.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> I don’t care twopence about India. I’d have been quite content with Western Australia.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> My dear, you don’t think I’d have let you bury yourself in Western Australia?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Or Barbadoes.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> Never. It sounds like a cure for flat feet. I’d have kept you in London.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> [<i>Surprised, rather amused, and delighted.</i>] Hughie, you don’t mean to say you’re jealous of poor Clive?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> Of course I’m not jealous of him, but he does look at you in a way that I can’t help thinking rather objectionable.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Hughie, you may throw me downstairs like Amy Robsart; you may drag me about the floor by the hair of my head; I don’t care, you’re jealous. I shall never grow old.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> Damn it all, the man was your husband.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> My dear Hughie, he never had your style. Why, the moment you come into a room everyone looks and says: “Who the devil is that?”</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> What? You think that, do you? Well, I daresay there’s something in what you say. These damned Radicals can say what they like, but, by God, Kitty! when a man’s a gentleman—well, damn it all, you know what I mean.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Yes. And now they have I think I knew it all along.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> I don’t expect you to have much sympathy for me. Arnold is your son.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> So pitifully little.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> I’m not suited for this sort of existence. Arnold wants me to take what he calls my place in Society. Oh, I get so bored with those parties in London. All those middle-aged painted women, in beautiful clothes, lolloping round ball-rooms with rather old young men. And the endless luncheons where they gossip about so-and-so’s love affairs.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Are you very much in love with Mr. Luton?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> I love him with all my heart.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> And he?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> He’s never cared for anyone but me. He never will.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Will Arnold let you divorce him?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> No, he won’t hear of it. He refuses even to divorce me.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Why?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> He thinks a scandal will revive all the old gossip.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Oh, my poor child!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> It can’t be helped. I’m quite willing to accept the consequences.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> You don’t know what it is to have a man tied to you only by his honour. When married people don’t get on they can separate, but if they’re not married it’s impossible. It’s a tie that only death can sever.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> If Teddie stopped caring for me I shouldn’t want him to stay with me for five minutes.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> One says that when one’s sure of a man’s love, but when one isn’t any more—oh, it’s so different. In those circumstances one’s got to keep a man’s love. It’s the only thing one has.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> I’m a human being. I can stand on my own feet.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Have you any money of your own?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> None.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Then how can you stand on your own feet? You think I’m a silly, frivolous woman, but I’ve learned something in a bitter school. They can make what laws they like, they can give us the suffrage, but when you come down to bedrock it’s the man who pays the piper who calls the tune. Woman will only be the equal of man when she earns her living in the same way that he does.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> [<i>Smiling.</i>] It sounds rather funny to hear you talk like that.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> A cook who marries a butler can snap her fingers in his face because she can earn just as much as he can. But a woman in your position and a woman in mine will always be dependent on the men who keep them.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> I don’t want luxury. You don’t know how sick I am of all this beautiful furniture. These over-decorated houses are like a prison in which I can’t breathe. When I drive about in a Callot frock and a Rolls-Royce I envy the shop-girl in a coat and skirt whom I see jumping on the tailboard of a bus.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> You mean that if need be you could earn your own living?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Yes.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> What could you be? A nurse or a typist. It’s nonsense. Luxury saps a woman’s nerve. And when she’s known it once it becomes a necessity.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> That depends on the woman.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> When we’re young we think we’re different from everyone else, but when we grow a little older we discover we’re all very much of a muchness.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> You’re very kind to take so much trouble about me.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> It breaks my heart to think that you’re going to make the same pitiful mistake that I made.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Oh, don’t say it was that, don’t, don’t.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Look at me, Elizabeth, and look at Hughie. Do you think it’s been a success? If I had my time over again do you think I’d do it again? Do you think he would?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> You see, you don’t know how much I love Teddie.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> And do you think I didn’t love Hughie? Do you think he didn’t love me?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> I’m sure he did.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Oh, of course in the beginning it was heavenly. We felt so brave and adventurous and we were so much in love. The first two years were wonderful. People cut me, you know, but I didn’t mind. I thought love was everything. It <i>is</i> a little uncomfortable when you come upon an old friend and go towards her eagerly, so glad to see her, and are met with an icy stare.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Do you think friends like that are worth having?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Perhaps they’re not very sure of themselves. Perhaps they’re honestly shocked. It’s a test one had better not put one’s friends to if one can help it. It’s rather bitter to find how few one has.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> But one has some.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Yes, they ask you to come and see them when they’re quite certain no one will be there who might object to meeting you. Or else they say to you: “My dear, you know I’m devoted to you, and I wouldn’t mind at all, but my girl’s growing up—I’m sure you understand; you won’t think it unkind of me if I don’t ask you to the house?”</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> [<i>Smiling.</i>] That doesn’t seem to me very serious.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> At first I thought it rather a relief, because it threw Hughie and me together more. But you know, men are very funny. Even when they are in love they’re not in love all day long. They want change and recreation.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> I’m not inclined to blame them for that, poor dears.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Then we settled in Florence. And because we couldn’t get the society we’d been used to we became used to the society we could get. Loose women and vicious men. Snobs who liked to patronise people with a handle to their names. Vague Italian Princes who were glad to borrow a few francs from Hughie and seedy countesses who liked to drive with me in the Cascine. And then Hughie began to hanker after his old life. He wanted to go big game shooting, but I dared not let him go. I was afraid he’d never come back.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> But you knew he loved you.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Oh, my dear, what a blessed institution marriage is—for women, and what fools they are to meddle with it! The Church is so wise to take its stand on the indi—indi—</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Solu—</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Bility of marriage. Believe me, it’s no joke when you have to rely only on yourself to keep a man. I could never afford to grow old. My dear, I’ll tell you a secret that I’ve never told a living soul.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> What is that?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> My hair is not naturally this colour.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Really.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> I touch it up. You would never have guessed, would you?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Never.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Nobody does. My dear, it’s white, prematurely of course, but white. I always think it’s a symbol of my life. Are you interested in symbolism? I think it’s too wonderful.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> I don’t think I know very much about it.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> However tired I’ve been I’ve had to be brilliant and gay. I’ve never let Hughie see the aching heart behind my smiling eyes.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> [<i>Amused and touched.</i>] You poor dear.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> And when I saw he was attracted by some one else the fear and the jealousy that seized me! You see, I didn’t dare make a scene as I should have done if I’d been married—I had to pretend not to notice.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> [<i>Taken aback.</i>] But do you mean to say he fell in love with anyone else?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Of course he did eventually.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> [<i>Hardly knowing what to say.</i>] You must have been very unhappy.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Oh, I was, dreadfully. Night after night I sobbed my heart out when Hughie told me he was going to play cards at the club and I knew he was with that odious woman. Of course, it wasn’t as if there weren’t plenty of men who were only too anxious to console me. Men have always been attracted by me, you know.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Oh, of course, I can quite understand it.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> But I had my self-respect to think of. I felt that whatever Hughie did I would do nothing that I should regret.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> You must be very glad now.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Oh, yes. Notwithstanding all my temptations I’ve been absolutely faithful to Hughie in spirit.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> I don’t think I quite understand what you mean.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Well, there was a poor Italian boy, young Count Castel Giovanni, who was so desperately in love with me that his mother begged me not to be too cruel. She was afraid he’d go into a consumption. What could I do? And then, oh, years later, there was Antonio Melita. He said he’d shoot himself unless I—well, you understand I couldn’t let the poor boy shoot himself.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> D’you think he really would have shot himself?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Oh, one never knows, you know. Those Italians are so passionate. He was really rather a lamb. He had such beautiful eyes.</p>

    <p class="direction">[<i><span class="name">Elizabeth</span> looks at her for a long time and a</i><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-81">[Pg 81]</a></span> <i>certain horror seizes her of this dissolute, painted old woman.</i></p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> [<i>Hoarsely.</i>] Oh, but I think that’s—dreadful.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Are you shocked? One sacrifices one’s life for love and then one finds that love doesn’t last. The tragedy of love isn’t death or separation. One gets over them. The tragedy of love is indifference.</p>

    <p class="direction">[<i><span class="name">Arnold</span> comes in.</i></p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> I want you to listen to me for a few minutes, Elizabeth. I was so taken aback by what you told me just now that I lost my head. I was rather absurd and I beg your pardon. I said things I regret.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Oh, don’t blame yourself. I’m sorry that I should have given you occasion to say them.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> I want to ask you if you’ve quite made up your mind to go.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Quite.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> Just now I seem to have said all that I didn’t want to say and nothing that I did. I’m stupid and tongue-tied. I never told you how deeply I loved you.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Oh, Arnold!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> Please let me speak now. It’s so very difficult. If I seemed absorbed in politics and the house, and so on, to the exclusion of my interest in you, I’m dreadfully sorry. I suppose it was absurd of me to think you would take my great love for granted.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> But, Arnold, I’m not reproaching you.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> I’m reproaching myself. I’ve been tactless and neglectful. But I do ask you to believe that it hasn’t been because I didn’t love you. Can you forgive me?</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> I don’t think that there’s anything to forgive.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> It wasn’t till to-day when you talked of leaving me that I realised how desperately in love with you I was.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> After three years?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> I’m so proud of you. I admire you so much. When I see you at a party, so fresh and lovely, and everybody wondering at you, I have a sort of little thrill because you’re mine, and afterwards I shall take you home.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Oh, Arnold, you’re exaggerating.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> I can’t imagine this house without you. Life seems on a sudden all empty and meaningless. Oh, Elizabeth, don’t you love me at all?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> It’s much better to be honest. No.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> Doesn’t my love mean anything to you?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> I’m very grateful to you. I’m sorry to cause you pain. What would be the good of my staying with you when I should be wretched all the time?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> Do you love that man as much as all that? Does my unhappiness mean nothing to you?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Of course it does. It breaks my heart. You see, I never knew I meant so much to you. I’m so touched. And I’m so sorry, Arnold, really sorry. But I can’t help myself.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> Poor child, it’s cruel of me to torture you.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Oh, Arnold, believe me, I have tried to make the best of it. I’ve tried to love you, but I can’t. After all, one either loves or one doesn’t. Trying is no help. And now I’m at the end of my tether. I can’t help the consequences—I must do what my whole self yearns for.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> My poor child, I’m so afraid you’ll be unhappy. I’m so afraid you’ll regret.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> You must leave me to my fate. I hope you’ll forget me and all the unhappiness I’ve caused you.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> [<i>There is a pause. <span class="name">Arnold</span> walks up and</i><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-83">[Pg 83]</a></span> <i>down the room reflectively. He stops and faces her.</i>] If you love this man and want to go to him I’ll do nothing to prevent you. My only wish is to do what is best for you.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Arnold, that’s awfully kind of you. If I’m treating you badly at least I want you to know that I’m grateful for all your kindness to me.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> But there’s one favour I should like you to do me. Will you?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Oh, Arnold, of course I’ll do anything I can.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> Teddie hasn’t very much money. You’ve been used to a certain amount of luxury, and I can’t bear to think that you should do without anything you’ve had. It would kill me to think that you were suffering any hardship or privation.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Oh, but Teddie can earn enough for our needs. After all, we don’t want much money.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> I’m afraid my mother’s life hasn’t been very easy, but it’s obvious that the only thing that’s made it possible is that Porteous was rich. I want you to let me make you an allowance of two thousand a year.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Oh, no, I couldn’t think of it. It’s absurd.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> I beg you to accept it. You don’t know what a difference it will make.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> It’s awfully kind of you, Arnold. It humiliates me to speak about it. Nothing would induce me to take a penny from you.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> Well, you can’t prevent me from opening an account at my bank in your name. The money shall be paid in every quarter whether you touch it or not, and if you happen to want it, it will be there waiting for you.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> You overwhelm me, Arnold. There’s only one thing I want you to do for me. I should be very grateful if you would divorce me as soon as you possibly can.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> No, I won’t do that. But I’ll give you cause to divorce me.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> You!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> Yes. But of course you’ll have to be very careful for a bit. I’ll put it through as quickly as possible, but I’m afraid you can’t hope to be free for over six months.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> But, Arnold, your seat and your political career!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> Oh, well, my father gave up his seat under similar circumstances. He’s got along very comfortably without politics.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> But they’re your whole life.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> After all one can’t have it both ways. You can’t serve God and Mammon. If you want to do the decent thing you have to be prepared to suffer for it.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> But I don’t want you to suffer for it.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> At first I rather hesitated at the scandal. But I daresay that was only weakness on my part. Under the circumstances I should have liked to keep out of the Divorce Court if I could.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Arnold, you’re making me absolutely miserable.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> What you said before dinner was quite right. It’s nothing for a man, but it makes so much difference to a woman. Naturally I must think of you first.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> That’s absurd. It’s out of the question. Whatever there’s to pay I must pay it.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> It’s not very much I’m asking you, Elizabeth.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> I’m taking everything from you.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> It’s the only condition I make. My mind is absolutely made up. I will never divorce you, but I will enable you to divorce me.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Oh, Arnold, it’s cruel to be so generous.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Arnold.</span> It’s not generous at all. It’s the only way I have of showing you how deep and passionate and sincere my love is for you.</p>

    <p class="direction">[<i>There is a silence. He holds out his hand.</i></p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Forgive me for troubling you. But it’s very important.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> [<i>Smiling through her tears.</i>] Thanks. I never use one.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> When you’ve been solemnly kicked out of a house once I think it seems rather pushing to come back again as though nothing had happened.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Teddie, I want you to be serious.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> Darling, I had such a rotten dinner at that pub. If you ask me to be serious on the top of that I shall cry.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Don’t be idiotic, Teddie. [<i>Her voice faltering.</i>] I’m so utterly wretched.</p>

    <p class="direction">[<i>He looks at her for a moment gravely.</i></p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> What is it?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> I can’t come away with you, Teddie.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> Why not?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> [<i>Looking away in embarrassment.</i>] I don’t love you enough.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> Fiddle!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> [<i>With a flash of anger.</i>] Don’t say “Fiddle” to me.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> I shall say exactly what I like to you.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> I won’t be bullied.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> Now look here, Elizabeth, you know perfectly well that I’m in love with you, and I know perfectly well that you’re in love with me. So what are you talking nonsense for?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> [<i>Her voice breaking.</i>] I can’t say it if you’re cross with me.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> [<i>Smiling very tenderly.</i>] I’m not cross with you, silly.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> It’s harder still when you’re being rather an owl.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> [<i>With a chuckle.</i>] Am I mistaken in thinking you’re not very easy to please?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Oh, it’s monstrous. I was all wrought up<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-87">[Pg 87]</a></span> and ready to do anything, and now you’ve thoroughly put me out. I feel like a great big fat balloon that some one has put a long pin into. [<i>With a sudden look at him.</i>] Have you done it on purpose?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> Upon my soul I don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> I wonder if you’re really much cleverer than I think you are.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> [<i>Taking her hands and making her sit down.</i>] Now tell me exactly what you want to say. By the way, do you want Lady Kitty and Lord Porteous to be here?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Yes.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Elizabeth asked us to stay.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> Oh, I don’t mind, bless you. I only thought you might feel rather in the way.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> [<i>Frigidly.</i>] A gentlewoman never feels in the way, Mr. Luton.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> Won’t you call me Teddie? Everybody does, you know.</p>

    <p class="direction">[<i><span class="name">Lady Kitty</span> tries to give him a withering look, but she finds it very difficult to prevent herself from smiling. <span class="name">Teddie</span> strokes <span class="name">Elizabeth’s</span> hands. She draws them away.</i></p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> No, don’t do that. Teddie, it wasn’t true when I said I didn’t love you. Of course I love you. But Arnold loves me, too. I didn’t know how much.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> What has he been saying to you?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> He’s been very good to me, and so kind. I didn’t know he could be so kind. He offered to let me divorce him.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> That’s very decent of him.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> But don’t you see, it ties my hands. How can I accept such a sacrifice? I should never forgive myself if I profited by his generosity.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> If another man and I were devilish hungry and there was only one mutton chop between us, and he<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-88">[Pg 88]</a></span> said, “You eat it,” I wouldn’t waste a lot of time arguing. I’d wolf it before he changed his mind.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> Don’t talk like that. It maddens me. I’m trying to do the right thing.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> You’re not in love with Arnold; you’re in love with me. It’s idiotic to sacrifice your life for a slushy sentiment.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> After all, I did marry him.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> Well, you made a mistake. A marriage without love is no marriage at all.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> <i>I</i> made the mistake. Why should he suffer for it? If anyone has to suffer it’s only right that I should.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> What sort of a life do you think it would be with him? When two people are married it’s very difficult for one of them to be unhappy without making the other unhappy too.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> I can’t take advantage of his generosity.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> I daresay he’ll get a lot of satisfaction out of it.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> You’re being beastly, Teddie. He was simply wonderful. I never knew he had it in him. He was really noble.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> You are talking rot, Elizabeth.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> I wonder if you’d be capable of acting like that.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> Acting like what?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> What would you do if I were married to you and came and told you I loved somebody else and wanted to leave you?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> You have very pretty blue eyes, Elizabeth. I’d black first one and then the other. And after that we’d see.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> You damned brute!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> I’ve often thought I wasn’t quite a gentleman. Had it ever struck you?</p>

    <p class="direction">[<i>They look at one another for a while.</i></p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> You know, you are taking an unfair<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-89">[Pg 89]</a></span> advantage of me. I feel as if I came to you quite unsuspectingly and when I wasn’t looking you kicked me on the shins.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> Don’t you think we’d get on rather well together?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> Elizabeth’s a fool if she don’t stick to her husband. It’s bad enough for the man, but for the woman—it’s damnable. I hold no brief for Arnold. He plays bridge like a foot. Saving your presence, Kitty, I think he’s a prig.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Poor dear, his father was at his age. I daresay he’ll grow out of it.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> But you stick to him, Elizabeth, stick to him. Man is a gregarious animal. We’re members of a herd. If we break the herd’s laws we suffer for it. And we suffer damnably.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Oh, Elizabeth, my dear child, don’t go. It’s not worth it. It’s not worth it. I tell you that, and I’ve sacrificed everything to love.</p>

    <p class="direction">[<i>A pause.</i></p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> I’m afraid.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> [<i>In a whisper.</i>] Elizabeth.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Elizabeth.</span> I can’t face it. It’s asking too much of me. Let’s say good-bye to one another, Teddie. It’s the only thing to do. And have pity on me. I’m giving up all my hope of happiness.</p>

    <p class="direction">[<i>He goes up to her and looks into her eyes.</i></p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> But I wasn’t offering you happiness. I don’t think my sort of love tends to happiness. I’m jealous. I’m not a very easy man to get on with. I’m often out of temper and irritable. I should be fed to the teeth with you sometimes, and so would you be with me. I daresay we’d fight like cat and dog, and sometimes we’d hate each other. Often you’d be wretched and bored stiff and lonely, and often you’d be frightfully homesick, and then you’d regret all you’d lost. Stupid women would be rude to you because we’d run away together. And some of them would<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-90">[Pg 90]</a></span> cut you. I don’t offer you peace and quietness. I offer you unrest and anxiety. I don’t offer you happiness. I offer you love.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> That’s awfully kind of you. As a matter of fact I got it out of the garage. It’s just along the drive.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> [<i>Indignantly.</i>] How do you mean, you got it out of the garage?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> Well, I thought there’d be a lot of bother, and it seemed to me the best thing would be for Elizabeth and me not to stand upon the order of our going, you know. Do it now. An excellent motto for a business man.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> Do you mean to say you were going to steal my car?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Teddie.</span> Not exactly. I was only going to bolshevise it, so to speak.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> I’m speechless. I’m absolutely speechless.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Oh, Hughie, how it all comes back to me! Will they suffer all we suffered? And have we suffered all in vain?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> My dear, I don’t know that in life it matters so much what you do as what you are. No one can learn by the experience of another because no circumstances are quite the same. If we made rather a hash of things perhaps it was because we were rather trivial people. You can do anything in this world if you’re prepared to take the consequences, and consequences depend on character.</p>

    <p class="direction">[<i>Enter <span class="name">Champion-Cheney,</span> rubbing his hands. He is as pleased as Punch.</i></p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> Whose hash are you talking about?</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> Mr. Edward Luton’s, my dear Hughie. I told Arnold exactly what to do and he’s done it. What makes a prison? Why, bars and bolts. Remove them and a prisoner won’t want to escape. Clever, I flatter myself.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Porteous.</span> You were always that, Clive, but at the moment you’re obscure.</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> I told Arnold to go to Elizabeth and tell her she could have her freedom. I told him to sacrifice himself all along the line. I know what women are. The moment every obstacle was removed to her marriage with Teddie Luton, half the allurement was gone.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Lady Kitty.</span> Arnold did that?</p>

    <p><span class="name">C.-C.</span> He followed my instructions to the letter. I’ve just seen him. She’s shaken. I’m willing to bet five hundred pounds to a penny that she won’t bolt. A downy old bird, eh? Downy’s the word. Downy.</p>

      <p>The following changes were noted:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>In the original text, titles for each act (e.g., “THE FIRST ACT”) were printed on otherwise blank pages. In addition, the associated versos were blank, as were two of the pages facing these pages. These pages were not included or otherwise identified in the transcription, and thus in the html version of this transcription pp. 6-8, pp. 34-35, and pp. 64-66 are missing from the page count.</li>

        <li>p. 15: …and a note was found on the pin-cushion.—Deleted hyphen in “pin-cushion” for consistency.</li>

        <li>p. 36: …you’ll discover that onlokers are expected…—Changed “onlokers” to “onlookers”.</li>

        <li>p. 40: She’s tinsel You think I’m…—Inserted a period after “tinsel”.</li>

        <li>p. 44: [<i>Almost giving it up as a bad job.</i> Oh, my God!—Inserted a closing bracket after “<i>job.</i>”</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The html version of this etext attempts to reproduce the layout of the printed text. However, some concessions have been made. For example, stage directions printed flush right were indented the same amount from the left margin and coded as hanging paragraphs.</p>
